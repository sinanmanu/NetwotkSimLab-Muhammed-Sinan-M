Network Simulation Lab Report – GNS3

Student Name: Muhammed Sinan M
Date: 17/11/2025

Objective

The purpose of this lab was to understand basic network simulation using GNS3 in a virtual environment, create simple switch-based topologies, test connectivity, and document the results using GitHub for submission.

Tools & Environment

Operating System: Windows
Simulation Software: GNS3 (GUI + Local server)
Devices Used: VPCS (virtual PCs), Ethernet switches
Version Control & Submission: GitHub (public repository)


Part A – Installation

✔ Installed GNS3 on Windows
✔ Verified GNS3 Local Server (green status)
 
Part B – Network Topologies

1.	Topology 1 – Simple LAN
	2 PCs, 1 Switch
	Connected PCs through switch

 
Assigned IP addresses (same subnet)
 

Successful ping between PCs


2.	Topology 2 – Star Topology
	4 PCs, 1 Switch
	Central switch connected to all PCs
 

Assigned IP addresses
 






All devices successfully pinged


  


3.	Topology 3 – Multi-Switch Mesh
	3 switches interconnected in loop
	1 PC per switch
 

All PCs assigned IPs in same subnet
Verified full end-to-end connectivity
 






Part D – GitHub Submission

Created a public repository named:
NetworkSimLab-Muhammed Sinan M
GitHub URL submitted in ICTAK Paatshala: https://github.com/sinanmanu/NetwotkSimLab-Muhammed-Sinan-M
