Network Simulation Lab – Muhammed Sinan M

This repository contains the practical work, configurations, and documentation for the Network Simulation Laboratory tasks. The exercises cover basic to intermediate networking concepts using tools like GNS3, Wireshark, and the Linux terminal. Each module reinforces core networking skills needed for academic and practical understanding.
